The app creates a global chatroom wherein each member joining the link can chat with others. 
As soon as someone ( say XYZ) visits the web app, everyone present in the room will be informed that "XYZ has entered the chat". He/She can now chat with other members.
When he/she leaves, others will be promptly informed that "XYZ has left the chat". One has to only enter his/her name ( which can be any random name) to use the application". The online users are also shown in the left pane.
